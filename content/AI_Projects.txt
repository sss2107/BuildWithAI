[PROJECT_1_TITLE]
Curie - HR Policy Chatbot (Agentic Framework)

[PROJECT_1_ORG]
Singapore Airlines | 2022 - Present

[PROJECT_1_DESCRIPTION]
Designed and developed Curie, an employee-facing HR chatbot for answering HR policy-related questions using a router-based agentic framework. The system intelligently analyzes user queries and routes them to the appropriate policy domain (Finance, Leave, Appraisal, IT, Code of Conduct, Medical Reimbursement, Payroll, etc.), then employs a retrieval system to identify relevant page numbers and provide context-aware responses.

[PROJECT_1_ACHIEVEMENTS]
Intelligent policy routing across 7+ HR domains
Reduced HR query response time by 80%
24/7 automated policy assistance for employees
High accuracy context retrieval system
Production deployment serving 1000s of employees
