[PROJECT_1_TITLE]
Curie - HR Policy Chatbot (Agentic Framework)

[PROJECT_1_ORG]
Singapore Airlines | 2022 - Present

[PROJECT_1_DESCRIPTION]
Designed and developed Curie, an employee-facing HR chatbot for answering HR policy-related questions using a router-based agentic framework. The system intelligently analyzes user queries and routes them to the appropriate policy domain (Finance, Leave, Appraisal, IT, Code of Conduct, Medical Reimbursement, Payroll, etc.), then employs a retrieval system to identify relevant page numbers and provide context-aware responses.

[PROJECT_1_ACHIEVEMENTS]
Intelligent policy routing across 7+ HR domains
Reduced HR query response time by 80%
24/7 automated policy assistance for employees
High accuracy context retrieval system
Production deployment serving 1000s of employees

[PROJECT_2_TITLE]
AMS AI Agent - Production Support Automation

[PROJECT_2_ORG]
Singapore Airlines | 2023 - Present

[PROJECT_2_DESCRIPTION]
Built an intelligent AI agent that automates Application Management Services (AMS) workflows and production support tasks. The agent autonomously handles user-reported issues post-deployment by connecting to multiple systems: application codebases (via Git/repositories), infrastructure and application logs (Splunk), databases (S3, Data Mart), and external systems (Altea). Using a multi-tool agentic framework, the system diagnoses issues, queries relevant data sources, and provides resolutions without manual intervention.

[PROJECT_2_ACHIEVEMENTS]
9 production applications successfully onboarded
Autonomous issue diagnosis and resolution
Multi-system integration (codebase, logs, databases, external apps)
Reduced production support response time
24/7 automated incident handling
